# Come Down

An Obsidian plugin that caches embedded external images to your local device.





The cache is located within the plugin's folder, so the cached files:

- will sync along with the rest of the vault if the vault is in iCloud Drive or any other file-syncing service that syncs the entire vault
- will be excluded from Git because a `.gitignore` file is placed in the cache folder
- will not sync with [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync)
